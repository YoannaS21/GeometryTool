# GeometryTool
This C++ program, named "Geometry Tool," provides a set of tools for geometric computations and analyses. It covers various aspects of geometry, including points, lines, triangles, and parabolas. The user interacts with the program through a command-line interface, choosing specific tools to perform geometric calculations.

Features
1. Check whether a point lies on a line
Users can input a point and a line, and the program determines if the point lies on the line.

2. Derive an equation of a line parallel to a given line and passing through a point
Users input a point and a line, and the program calculates and outputs the equation of a parallel line passing through the given point.

3. Derive an equation of a line perpendicular to a given line and passing through a point
Users input a point and a line, and the program calculates and outputs the equation of a perpendicular line passing through the given point.

4. Find the intersection point of two lines
Users input two lines, and the program calculates and outputs the intersection point if it exists.

5. Construct equations of the heights of a triangle
Users input three points representing a triangle, and the program constructs and outputs the equations of the triangle's heights.

6. Construct equations of the medians of a triangle
Users input three points representing a triangle, and the program constructs and outputs the equations of the triangle's medians.

7. Construct equations of the bisectors of a triangle
Users input three points representing a triangle, and the program constructs and outputs the equations of the triangle's bisectors.

8. Derive the equation of the tangent to a parabola at a given point
Users input the coefficients of a parabola and a point on the real line, and the program calculates and outputs the equation of the tangent.

9. Find the intersection points of a parabola and a line
Users input the coefficients of a parabola and a line, and the program calculates and outputs the intersection points.

10. Determine the type of quadrilateral formed by four lines
Users input four lines, and the program determines and outputs the type of quadrilateral formed by the lines.
